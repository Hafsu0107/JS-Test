//Events: An event in JavaScript is something that happens on a web page. 
// It could be triggered by a user action (like clicking a button, typing in a text box,
//  or moving the mouse) or by the browser itself (like the page finishing loading or the window being resized).

//Events let us make web pages interactive because we can write code that listens for an event and does something in response, like showing a message, changing a color, or loading more content.

//Example:
//Event: Clicking a button.
// Response: Show an alert.
